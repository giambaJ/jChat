**jChat** is an overlay that allows you to show your Twitch chat on screen with OBS, XSplit, and any other streaming software that supports browser sources. It supports your [**BetterTTV**](https://betterttv.com/), [**FrankerFaceZ**](https://www.frankerfacez.com/) and [**7TV**](https://7tv.app/) emotes, always at the best available quality. You have many options to customize your chat, like enabling a smooth animation for new messages, or fading old ones after some time. If you have a chat full of !gamble addicts, you can choose to hide bots and commands messages. It also comes with many fonts and styling options that can be combined as desired.
